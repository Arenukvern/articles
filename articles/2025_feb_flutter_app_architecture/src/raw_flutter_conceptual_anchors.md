Okay, the user is asking about creating conceptual anchors for domain knowledge in app development using Flutter and Cursor AI. They mentioned they don't have access to fine-tune remote models, only the prompt window. So, I need to focus on prompt engineering techniques rather than model tweaking.

First, I should think about how to structure prompts to include domain-specific terms and context. Maybe using consistent terminology and structured formats like JSON or DSL could help. Also, the user provided an example task about creating a local data source for incomes and expenses. I need to address how to convey that effectively to the AI.

The user might benefit from creating a domain glossary, using structured context headers, and state tracking in prompts. Maybe suggesting a prompt template with placeholders for their specific classes and requirements would be useful. Including code examples in the prompt could guide the AI to generate more accurate responses.

I should also consider how to handle the app's architecture, like Clean Architecture or Repository pattern, and ensure the AI understands the layers involved. Providing a sample prompt that includes class names, data types, and specific requirements would help the user see how to structure their own prompts.

Additionally, mentioning grammar tips and prompt improvement suggestions, as per their custom instructions, would add value. Maybe pointing out the importance of consistent terminology and avoiding vague terms.

Finally, I need to make sure the answer is concise, uses code blocks for examples, and adheres to the user's preferred professional yet collaborative tone.

Here's how to implement conceptual anchors for Flutter development with Cursor's AI:

**1. Domain-Specific Prompt Architecture**

```text
// In your prompt template
[App Context]
- Architecture: Clean Architecture (Data-Domain-Presentation)
- State Management: Riverpod
- Local Storage: Hive
- Current Finance Classes:
  {{
  class FinancialRecord {
    final DateTime date;
    final double amount;
    final bool isIncome;
    // ... existing fields ...
  }
  }}

[Task]
Create a local data source implementation that:
- Persists FinancialRecord objects
- Supports CRUD operations
- Handles initial loading sequence
- Maintains data integrity during async operations

[Output Requirements]
- Use Hive TypeAdapters
- Follow repository pattern
- Include error handling
- Add documentation
```

**2. Conceptual Anchors for Financial Apps**

```dart
// In your code (these act as both documentation and AI anchors)
/// [FinancialPersistenceContract] | [HiveAdapterRegistry]
/// [TransactionSyncHandler] | [LedgerInitializationSequence]
/// [BalanceReconciliationFlow] | [FiscalPeriodCache]

// Example usage in prompts:
"Implement [HiveAdapterRegistry] for [FinancialRecord] following [FinancialPersistenceContract]"
```

**3. AI Interaction Protocol**

```text
When requesting code generation, use this structure:
1. Context Header: "Flutter 3.19 | Riverpod 2.3 | Hive 3.0"
2. Architecture Layer: "[Data Layer]"
3. Component Type: "[Repository Implementation]"
4. Specific Dependencies: "Depends on [LocalStorageService]"
5. Error Cases: "Handle [HiveBoxInitFailure] [WriteConflict]"
```

**4. Response Shaping**

```text
Add to prompts:
"Format response with:
- Section headers in [brackets]
- Riverpod providers marked with [Provider]
- Type definitions prefixed with [Type]
- Error classes as [Error]"
```

**Example Task Implementation Prompt:**

```text
[App Context: FinancialTracker 2.3]
[Current Components: FinancialRecord class (see code)]
[Storage: Hive 3.2.2 with automatic TypeAdapters]

[Task: Local Data Source Implementation]
Create a [HiveLocalDataSource] implementing:
- Save individual [FinancialRecord]
- Bulk load during [AppInitializationPhase]
- Conflict resolution using [LastWriteWins] strategy
- Error wrapping with [LocalStorageException]

[Output Requirements]
- Use [Riverpod Provider] for dependency injection
- Add [HiveTypeAdapter] registration logic
- Include [BackupRestoreMechanism] stub
```

**Result-Boosting Techniques:**

1. **Code-Linked Prompts**: Paste actual class signatures before requests
2. **Architecture Tags**: Prefix prompts with [Clean Architecture: Data Layer]
3. **Version Anchors**: Specify "Flutter 3.19.6" (your current version)
4. **Error Taxonomy**: Define custom error classes in prompts
5. **Pattern Enforcement**: "Use explicit interface implementation pattern"

**Grammar Tip**: Use consistent capitalization for domain terms ("FinancialRecord" vs "financial record") to improve AI recognition.

**Prompt Improvement**:
Instead of: "Make a save system for money things"
Use: "Implement [HiveLocalDataSource] following [FinancialPersistenceContract] for [FinancialRecord] objects with [Riverpod 2.3] dependency injection"

This approach creates strong conceptual anchors through:

- Bracketed terminology for technical terms
- Architecture pattern enforcement
- Version-specific context
- Code structure templates
- Domain-specific error taxonomy
