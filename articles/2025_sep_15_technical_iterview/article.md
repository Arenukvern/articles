First of all, you need to understand who and for what tasks you are looking for.

For example, if you need a developer who can adjust and adapt to tasks, then you should ask about what techniques/methods they use to learn something new, how often they are interested in new things themselves – you can ask how they would conduct research, and if they have had similar experience.

If you "urgently need a developer" for "this task for a week" you must definitely consider that they will need to get familiar with the codebase and the project itself (adaptation time) – and it’s good if this takes a week or two. Ask a developer does he have such experience, and how comfortable he would work in such case (because any urgent cases usually are the most stressful ones).

You also may ask does the developer had experience to reorganize planning, to organize more non-stressful process and if he had such - how exactly?

If you need a developer "to build an app from scratch," it’s better to ask if they have such experience, how much they interacted with designers/products, if they have experience in design development, client communication, and if they have their own codebase.

The best way to conduct an interview in this case is to describe a small business task (as a complete application) and ask them to estimate what will be required in terms of architecture, tasks, planning, and team interaction to complete the project.

In all cases, it’s worth asking about motivation (of course, besides the financial aspect), priorities, and future growth (where the person roughly aims to get and why).

Why this is important:

In my opinion, everything depends on what kind of people are gathered in the team – how they will work together, whether there will be synergy – sharing experience between developers/designers/products.

A very important point when evaluating tasks is not that such a task has already been done, but who exactly will do it – someone may already have experience in similar tasks, for someone this particular domain will be unknown, and edge cases will be resolved later...
