Software Architect (Flutter) with UX & AI skills
Anton Malofeev, (GMT+3), Saint Petersburg, Russia


About
Hi, I’m Anton👋
My work is based on:
Ethical Principles.
Why: when business have certain principles to design software, it usually prioritizes creating unique value for End User. This helps a lot with defining how team communicates with each other, how application looks and function, how code is written (by knowing constraints and freedoms within). Also by having ethical principles it is clear when AI can be used (in end product or in IDE), and when it shouldn’t.
User & Team Experience.
In my work I prioritize impact for End User and sense of team while working with other people. Meaning: I value other people experience and believe that culture of experience sharing is worth the time.
Value via Care & Innovation.I believe that the app should be simple, focused and worth of people time who is using it. Combining with growing technologies, especially AI (cloud or on-device LLMs), I believe that so many things can be reimagined and fundamentally rethought making User experience as priority.
AI:
I use Cursor (mostly) for writing a code. But thinking of the code as co-colleague, who can teach me new things, reimagine old things. In the same time, every my decision where I use it and why is based on Ethical principles - this allows me to build faster but with more quality for End User and Developer. ( https://medium.com/@antmalofeev/small-thought-developer-ethics-may-be-a-bridge-to-work-with-ai-tools-cd60cf43c856)
Developer & Designer & QA as User.In my opinion that every person who can access a code is a user too. Meaning: writing useful documentation, making API useful, making Design System accessible for Designer, getting any feedback (via code review, or application preview) is extremely important for me. In my opinion this process makes not only product better, but every person who involved in its creation.
Prototyping. From my experience many of the great ideas and practices are coming from iterations and fast prototyping - because it is not only allows to feel the idea, but to share, and experience it yourself and share with others. And hearing the feedback is most of important part of prototyping too 🙂
Timing.
Usually I use simple formula to get most correct time: Team + Known Knowledge + My Experience + My Experience in the codebase | domain.Meaning: when measuring how long feature/bug/app can be developed I usually need to know the people who works with me, then the codebase and then combine it with all I know.

Will be glad to discuss your project and have a nice day!
My best regards,
Anton
